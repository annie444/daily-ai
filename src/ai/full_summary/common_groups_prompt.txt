You are generating the "common_groups" field of a daily engineering log.
This field represents high-level categories of work inferred from the full day’s activity across shell, Git, and browser history.

Your task is to produce a short list of 4–8 concise group labels, each representing a meaningful, recurring context of work.

=====================
STYLE REQUIREMENTS
=====================

Each item should be:
* A short noun phrase, 2–4 words
* Title-case (e.g., "Rust Development")
* Describing a project, domain, or technical context
* Not a sentence, not verbose

Examples of correct group labels:
* "Daily-AI CLI"
* "Rust Development"
* "Home Lab Automation"
* "OpenShift Networking"
* "Ansible Collections"
* "NEOS Configuration"
* "Euclid Cluster Setup"
* "CephFS Cluster Maintenance"

======================
HOW TO USE TOOL OUTPUT
======================

The initial JSON provided to you is incomplete.

The full story must be reconstructed using hydrated data:
* Use shell history to trace debugging loops.
* Use Git diffs to understand what code was changed and why.
* Use browser research clusters to infer what I was learning or fixing.
* Use commit bodies and diffs to understand motivation and scope.

Do not merely restate this tool output.
Integrate it into an explanation of my day.

======================
WHAT COUNTS AS A GROUP
======================

You may create a group when:
* Multiple commands involve the same directory/repo
* Multiple Git commits affect the same codebase
* Browser clusters show research into a specific library or subsystem
* Work clearly relates to a named tool or project
* The activity forms a coherent technical theme

Groups should represent themes, not individual events.

====================
WHAT MUST NOT APPEAR
====================

You must never generate groups based on:
* Authentication redirects (Caltech SSO, Okta, SAML, Google Workspace)
* Single, trivial shell commands (ls, cd, cat, etc.)
* File opens or accidental browsing
* General web browsing not associated with work
* One-off events or unconnected noise
* Social media, news, or irrelevant content

Groups must be work-relevant and technically meaningful.

====================
INFERENCE GUIDELINES
====================

You may infer project names from:
* Repo paths
* If working in `.../daily-ai`, group should be "Daily-AI CLI" or similar.
* Repeated browser research
* Research into nom, serde, or JSON parsing -> "Rust Development"
* Shell histories with repeated commands
* Repeated chezmoi commands -> "Chezmoi Dotfiles"
* Project-specific tooling
* opencode config files -> "Opencode Configuration"

You may adapt names to be clean and human-friendly, but do not hallucinate entirely new projects.

=============
OUTPUT FORMAT
=============

Output a JSON array of strings:

```
{
  "common_groups": [
    "Daily-AI CLI",
    "Chezmoi Dotfiles",
    "Rust Development"
  ],
  "notes": [
    "Focus on meaningful, recurring contexts of work.",
    "Avoid trivial or one-off events.",
    "Use hydrated data from shell, Git, and browser history to inform group labels.",
    "Ensure groups are work-relevant and technically significant."
  ]
}
```

No objects, no summaries, no extra explanation.

========================
NOTES FIELD INSTRUCTIONS
========================

Your output must include a "notes" field, which is a JSON array of strings.
These notes are internal guidance the assistant generates for itself to refine context, track uncertainties, or identify additional data that would improve reasoning on future steps.

The "notes" array:
* Must contain 0 or more short strings
* Each string should reflect a technical observation, inference cue, or reminder about missing context
  * e.g., "Repeated cargo test failures indicate parser instability before refactor."
* Should not describe final output — only meta-level insights useful for follow-up reasoning
* Must not speculate beyond the provided data
* Must not contain personal opinions, filler text, or restatements of the summary fields

Example structure:

```
"notes": [
  "Timestamp serialization errors correlated with repeated failing test runs.",
  "Research into nom indicates parser redesign was intentional."
]
```

If no internal guidance is needed for this request, return an empty array.

==================
STRICT CONSTRAINTS
==================

* 2–6 items only.
* Do not use first-person pronouns.
* No markdown.
* No filler categories (e.g., "General Work", "Miscellaneous").
* Do not mention internal browser noise, authentication URLs, or unrelated sites.
